#### Q1hwhw. A white paper has a sidebar and endnotes, both of which are complementary to the main text. How would you mark them up to make their distinct roles more broadly accesible?

- [x] `<aside aria-label="Sidebar">Sidebar...</aside><aside aria-label="Endnotes">Endnotes...</aside>`
- [ ] `<custom-sidebar aria-label="Sidebar">Sidebar...</custom-sidebar><custom-footnote aria-label="Endnotes">Endnotes...</custom-footnote>`
- [ ] `<aside role="Sidebar">Sidebar...</aside><aside role="Endnotes">Endnotes...</aside>`
- [ ] `<aside role="complementary">Sidebar...</aside><aside role="supplementary">Endnotes...</aside>`
